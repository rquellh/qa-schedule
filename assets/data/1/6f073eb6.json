We can squeeze more value out of our already existing automated UI scripts and, with just a little bit of extra effort, add another layer of potential validations that they can perform. The data that we extract can assist us in ensuring the integrity of the data we are sending, checking HTML responses for errors, or even tracking response times for performance. This session will cover some tools we can use to add network traffic monitoring to our tests, and the different types of uses we might have for this extra data.","time":"10:30 - 11:30","room":"Great Hall 1 & 2","linkedin":"","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":""}},"context":{}}
