When not at work, Dave is spending time with his wife Leah typically hiking or diving into the fine art of home improvement fixes (typically things he broke).","bio2":"","title":"A Lifecycle Of Code Under Test","abstract":"When thinking about tests against code, have you \"done enough?\" How do you know that the code is covered appropriately, that odd bugs aren't going to crop up?
