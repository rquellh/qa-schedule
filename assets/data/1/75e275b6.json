Over those two years they’ve amassed over 1,000 photos of my son. To download all of these pictures manually would take me hours on hours of time; not to mention he still has 4 more years of daycare and my daughter has started attending this year. I knew there had to be a better way.\n\nFollow me on my automation journey as I show you some tips, tricks, and stumbling blocks that I uncovered while trying to preserve my children’s memories.","time":"12:45 - 1:45","room":"Great Hall 1 & 2","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanquellhorst","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":""}},"context":{}}
