Just because a scenario CAN be automated does not mean it SHOULD be automated. Teams that adopt automation often rush to automate everything they can -- the automation firehose. For those scenarios that should automated, every team must adopt an implementation plan to ensure value is derived from reliable automated test execution. In this session, the audience will learn how to automate both strategically and tactically to maximize the benefits of automation. Entry criteria will be demonstrated for automation in the development lifecycle along with a set of checks to determine automation feasibility & ROI.","time":"3:05 - 4:05","room":"Interfaith Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-haver","twitter":"https://twitter.com/cogsfun","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":""}},"context":{}}
