And what if I say you can cut your budget unbelievably if you get to eliminate licensed tools and by using open source tools as it is and modifying them accordingly? That is what exactly we did at Sysco, a global leader in selling, marketing, and distributing food products.\n\nMoving on to the story how a real fortune is saved, Our open source transformation was started back in 2017. By that time, almost all tools associated with quality engineering were commercialized tools. Less than three years, we have transformed a 95% QE tools usage to open source.\n\nIn this transformation, a QE platform has been built in house using the open-source. The beauty of the platform is that it supports the test scripting,  execution, reporting and results analysis.  Also, the platform caters functional and non-functional test and various OSs such as Linux, Windows, Mac and AS400 and tech stacks such as Java, NodeJS, .Net and Cobolt.\n\nThe platform has been used in the more than 50 products development teams and across globally such North America, Europe and Asia.","time":"12:45 - 1:45","room":"Student Alumni Room","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-maktoum-yoosuf-b8790718","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":""}},"context":{}}
