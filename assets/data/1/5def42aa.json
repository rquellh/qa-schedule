As testers, we are often in the position of inducing cognitive dissonance in our stakeholders when we present them with evidence that their system is not ready for production, when they were confident that everything was on track and going well. So how can we present \"unbelievable\" test results in a way that will not only convince our audience but also spur them to take the steps required to bring their project back to a \"believable\" state? In this presentation, Richard will explore several techniques for presenting test results that will educate and enlighten the recipients, without any danger of causing mental distress.","time":"9:15 - 10:15","room":"Great Hall 1 & 2","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardstrang","twitter":"https://twitter.com/richardstrang1","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":""}},"context":{}}
