There are numerous places to start depending on your passions, and what a tester would like to achieve. You don’t have to master five programming languages in order to write your first API test, and you don’t have to be a Selenium expert to create your first record and playback test. Much like you don’t need to be a Jedi to use the force, automation can be a powerful tool in your arsenal even if you are not an automaton master.\n\nJoin Ford Arnett as we go through a hypothetical automation journey, starting with self doubt and mental barriers to success then moving onto small wins and finally how to become a master of your chosen craft.​","time":"3:05 - 4:05","room":"West Ballroom","linkedin":"","twitter":"","website":"","linkedin2":"","twitter2":"","website2":""}},"context":{}}
