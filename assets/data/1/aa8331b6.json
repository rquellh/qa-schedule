In both testing and automation development, we often have to endure suboptimal situations and difficult challenges such as unrealistic expectations, resistance to change, and an insistence that automation has to come from test cases.\n\nIn coping with these challenges, many people find solace in music; listening to and playing music can be a cathartic experience. Music, specifically titles and lyrics, can also be thought-provoking and motivating. Paul Grizzaffi, a self-proclaimed metalhead and rock-a-holic, is one of those people who is greatly affected by music. He not only has experience with testing and automation, he’s quite the aficionado of heavy music. His love of automation, testing, and music inspired the pun in the title.\n\nJoin us as Paul takes us on a tour of some impactful lyrics and song titles that frame memorable messages about testing and automation. Among the featured messages: we make our own expectations, automation is software development, and there are important business aspects related to automation and testing that cannot be ignored. \n\nTakeaways:\n• Find your friendlies; they can help evangelize your message\n• Automation does not replace testers; it does not have to come from test cases\n• Only automate if there is value, not just because of process.","time":"8:00 - 9:00","room":"East Ballroom"}}]},"session2":{"edges":[{"node":{"speaker":"Richard Douglass","speaker2":"","title":"Co-Creation Workshops: What Role Do They Play?","abstract":"Co-Creation workshops are becoming more prevalent in the product lifecycle.

Then we will walk through the 5 Layers of Security Testing and explore what is involved in doing a good job of each.\n\n1. Test Security Features.  We will start by looking at some of the security mechanisms our developers design into their code (e.g. encryption) and the ways we can collaborate with them to design good White-Box tests.  Then we will turn our attention to the various types of Security Requirements so we can ensure that our system testing of those requirements is adequate.\n\n2. Perform Negative Testing.  Not just for quality purposes, negative testing is also an important part of our security testing.  In this context, we will look at both white-box and black-box Fuzz Testing.\n\n3. Test Misuse and Abuse Cases.  To our consideration of Use Cases, we should add Abuse Cases and Misuse Cases – How might people abuse or misuse the system and how should it respond?\n\n4. Test for Common Bugs that open Vulnerabilities.  The mistakes the developers make that have the side-effect of opening security vulnerabilities are widely published and well known.
